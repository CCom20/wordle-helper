Wordle Helper (link: [wordle-guess-optimizer.herokuapp.com/](https://wordle-guess-optimizer.herokuapp.com/)) is a guess-optimizer for [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). It takes your guess and matches the correct and incorrect letters across a database of all possible words and returns a list of words with an "information value score". The score changes based on the value of the word and the number of words left, so the information value is relative to the list of available words, not relative to the whole original list of words.
